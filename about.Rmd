I am currently work as an Assistant Research Biostatistician at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics). I recently completed my MS in Biostatistics at [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/). 

I work with [Ronglai Shen](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/ronglai-shen) at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/) using multimodal genomic data from [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://cancergenome.nih.gov/) to validate and refine cancer subtype classifications. I also collaborate with [Venkat Seshan](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/venkatraman-seshan), providing statistical analysis for [Lymphoma SPORE](https://www.mskcc.org/research-programs/specialized-program-research-excellence-spore-lymphoma) translational research projects. My other main area of interest is working on an algorithm to detect clustering patterns of nonsense mutations across multiple cancer tumor types through the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) at Columbia (see research page for more details). 

Prior to switching careers into statistics, I received a BA in Philosophy and Theater from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), then moved to New York and worked on the regulatory side of clinical research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for 3 years before starting graduate school. I also enjoy writing and have editorial experience (grammar and style on research manuscripts prior to submission and on whole books prior to publication).
