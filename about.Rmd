I am an Assistant Research Biostatistician at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics). I recently completed my MS in Biostatistics at [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/). 

Prior to switching careers into statistics, I received a BA in Philosophy and Theater from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), then moved to New York and worked on the regulatory side of clinical research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for 3 years before starting graduate school. I also enjoy writing and have editorial experience (grammar and style on research manuscripts prior to submission and on whole books prior to publication).
