I am currently pursuing my MS in Biostatistics at [Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/) and work as a Data Analyst for the [Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health](https://www.columbiacardiology.org/research/research-centers-and-programs/center-behavioral-cardiovascular-health) at Columbia University Medical Center. 

I am also conducting research with [Ronglai Shen](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/ronglai-shen) at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/) and [Shuang Wang](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/sw2206) in the [Department of Biostatistics at Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics) using multimodal genomic data from [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://cancergenome.nih.gov/) to validate and refine breast cancer subtype classifications. My other main area of research is working on an algorithm to detect clustering patterns of nonsense mutations across multiple cancer tumor types through the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) at Columbia (see research page for more details). 

Prior to switching careers into statistics, I received a BA in Philosophy and Theater from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), then moved to New York and worked on the regulatory side of clinical research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center for 3 years before starting graduate school. I also enjoy writing and have editorial experience (grammar and style on research manuscripts prior to submission and on whole books prior to publication).
