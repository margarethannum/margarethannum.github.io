I primarily collaborate on projects using multimodal genomic data in oncology research at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/). I work with [Ronglai Shen](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/ronglai-shen)  using data from [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://cancergenome.nih.gov/) to research cancer subtype classification and refinement. I also collaborate with [Venkat Seshan](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/venkatraman-seshan), providing statistical analysis for [Lymphoma SPORE](https://www.mskcc.org/research-programs/specialized-program-research-excellence-spore-lymphoma) translational research projects. My other main area of interest is working on an algorithm to detect clustering patterns of nonsense mutations across multiple cancer tumor types under the guidance of [Yufeng Shen](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/people/yufeng-shen/) in the [Department of Biomedical Informatics](https://www.dbmi.columbia.edu/) at Columbia.
