I received a BA in Philosophy and Theater from the [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/) before moving to New York and working in clinical research at [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/) (MSK) for 3 years before starting my MS in Biostatistics at Columbia. 

This summer I am conducting research on breast cancer subtype classifications using data from [The Cancer Genome Atlas](https://cancergenome.nih.gov/) with [Ronglai Shen](https://www.mskcc.org/profile/ronglai-shen) at MSK and [Shuang Wang](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/people/our-faculty/sw2206) at Columbia.

I also work as a freelance content editor with experience editing books for first and second edition publication as well as editing research papers for grammar and style prior to journal submission.

Finally, I volunteer as the social media manager for [ScienceBasedMedicine.org](https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/).
